          Intellimize is a software platform that personalizes websites using machine learning. As the Director of Content, I was responsible for developing blogs, web pages, and videos that resonated with marketers and expanded the company’s creative portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
          I expanded the Intellimize video library and used these assets cross-functionally through sales prospecting, on our web pages, and on our social media channels. Thought leadership and customer stories were crucial for our written content, as was our relationship with Forbes. Here are a few pieces I worked on that highlight these objectives.

          Ooma is a SaaS platform and cloud-based telephony hub that provides business and residential communications services. Ooma was known as a leader in home VoIP technology for years but wanted to expand into the SMB and enterprise markets with relevant content and offerings.

          As the company’s first content hire, I worked with both the Director of Digital Marketing and the Director of Brand Marketing to create features pages, FAQs, ad copy for SEO/SEM, and traditional web page copy, all catered around small business. I also worked with both directors on branding and messaging on the company’s career page.

          EverString is a B2B sales and marketing platform that helps companies discover customers who are a better fit for their products and services. Developing a brand voice and thought leadership for this high-growth startup was key, but we also wanted to better explain the “how” behind many sales and marketing tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, I created a content calendar for EverString’s blog so that our content focused on thought leadership around the common struggles of modern sales and marketing teams, and solutions to help overcome them.

          Vode is an LED and architectural lighting design company that needed smart, hip content for its new blog. A lot of upfront research around lighting and architecture was poured into this project. Vode is still one of the most illuminating (no pun intended) writing experiences for me because it was both effective at driving their brand and served as a resource for readers. It was especially fun to use humor and a lighthearted tone in these posts to explain Vode’s sustainable technology.
